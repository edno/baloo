2 modes:
- Safe => data integrity
- Secured => data encryption

Safe mode: the server response uses an envelop with a AES hash using its private key, the verification can be done by any client using the public key

Secure mode: the client send encrypted queries and/or data
Secured query: AES encryption of queries using the public key, the server use its private key for reading the query to be executed
Secured data: AES encryption of data stored encrypted at server level, the encryption is done using a client private key.

Add audit trail system...?
